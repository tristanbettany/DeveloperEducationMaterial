# Developer Education Material

Sometimes as a developer you can find yourself becoming siloed inside a set of tools and languages, often these are the tools which you use in your day job. It can be hard to learn new skills on the job and expand your skillset when a company has a set of requirements you must meet using the existing tools you work with, so how do you solve this yourself, and expand you mind?

What it means is, that you soley are left responsible for developing yourself and your own skillset, either outside of work or finding new challenges in your career which can be tough in this economic climate. Assuming you desire to acrew knowledge and potentially scale the ranks in your career then extracurricular activity is by all means a necessity in this industry.

As a developer myself who has spent years outside of work learning all sorts of skills I have decided to ease the initial step of this for others, by collecting together a list of courses and reading material that I have come across over my time which would help developers inrease their skills themselves.

So here goes..
